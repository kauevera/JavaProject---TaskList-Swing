The "Task List", using Swing, is a Java project i made for test my Java's knowledge. In this project there are three columns, named of "To do", "Doing" and "Done", representating a Kanban layout. Therefore, the interface provides to users with an "add button" (for increment new elements to any columns), a field text to write the name of the task, a box with some selection options (which are the columns To-Do, Doing, and Done) and a "remove button" for remove any element from given column.
